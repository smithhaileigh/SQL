*In this project, you’re going to make your own table with some small set of “famous people”, then make more tables about things they do and join those to create nice human readable lists.
*Singers: What songs did they write? Where are they from?

/* Create table about the people and what they do here */

CREATE TABLE Artists (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    fullname TEXT,
    age INTEGER,
    nationality TEXT);
    
INSERT INTO Artists (fullname, age, nationality) VALUES ("Miley Cyrus",31, "US");
INSERT INTO Artists(fullname, age, nationality) VALUES ("Beyonce", 42, "US");
INSERT INTO Artists (fullname, age, nationality) VALUES ("Benson Boone", 21, "US");
INSERT INTO Artists (fullname, age, nationality) VALUES ("Jennifer Lopez", 54, "US");
INSERT INTO Artists (fullname, age, nationality) VALUES ("Post Malone", 28, "US");

CREATE table Songs  (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    artist_id INTEGER,
    music TEXT,
    year TEXT);
    
INSERT INTO Songs (artist_id, music,year) VALUES (1, "flowers", "2023");
